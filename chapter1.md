A statistical question is a question that can be answered by collecting data. Almost all data has some variability. Variability means that repeated measurements of similar items give different numbers (the numbers vary).

A deterministic question is a question with one exact answer. The number never changes.

Example of a statistical question:
How much time do students at  my school spend on math homework each week?

Example of a deterministic question:
How many pennies are in a dime?

Abby went to the store a bought a bag of jelly beans, and has not opened it yet. Which of the following is not a statistical question about jelly beans?


`@hint`
If there is only one possible correct answer to the question, it is deterministic.
If there are multiple possible correct answers, or the correct answer could change, then it is a statistical question.

`@possible_answers`
 - What is a typical number of jelly beans in a bag?
 - [How much does Abby's bag weigh?]
 - Which color is the most frequent?
 - If Abby closed her eyes, shook up the bag, reached in and grabbed a jelly bean, how likely will it be red?
 - What is the typical weight of a jelly bean?
 - How are the jelly beans distributed according to color?
